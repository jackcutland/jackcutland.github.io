                    <h3>How to Cook</h3>
                    <p> Preheat oven to 200°F (93°C) to keep items warm as you cook them.Cook the sausages: Heat a large frying pan over medium heat with a drizzle of vegetable oil. 
                        Add the sausages and cook, turning occasionally, until they're browned and cooked through, about 10-12 minutes. 
                        Transfer to a plate and keep warm in the oven.
                        Fry the bacon: In the same pan, cook the bacon rashers over medium heat until crisp and golden, 
                        about 3-4 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the sausages and keep warm in the oven.
                        Cook the black pudding and haggis: In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed. 
                        Cook the black pudding and haggis slices for 3-4 minutes per side or until heated through and slightly crispy 
                        on the edges. Transfer to the plate with the sausages and bacon and keep warm in the oven.
                        Fry the eggs: In a separate non-stick frying pan, heat a small amount of vegetable oil over medium heat. 
                        Crack the eggs into the pan and cook until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny, about 3 minutes. 
                        Season with salt and pepper, then transfer to a separate plate and keep warm in the oven.
                        Cook the tomatoes and mushrooms: In the same pan used for the black pudding and haggis, 
                        add a bit more oil if needed. Place the halved tomatoes, cut side down, and the mushroom halves in the pan. 
                        Cook for 3-4 minutes on each side, until softened and slightly charred. 
                        Season with salt and pepper and transfer to the plate with the other ingredients, keeping warm in the oven.
                        Heat the baked beans: In a small saucepan, heat the baked beans over low heat, 
                        stirring occasionally, until warmed through. Keep warm.Cook the potato scones: In the same pan used for the tomatoes 
                        and mushrooms, cook the potato scones for 1-2 minutes per side, until heated through and slightly crisp. 
                        Transfer to the plate with the other ingredients and keep warm in the oven.
                        Toast the bread: In a toaster or under a preheated broiler, toast the bread slices until golden brown.
                        Assemble and serve: On each plate, place 2 sausages, 2 rashers of bacon, 1 slice of black pudding, 1 slice of haggis, 
                        1 fried egg, 2 tomato halves, 4 mushroom halves, a generous spoonful of baked beans, 1 potato scone, and a slice of 
                        toast. Serve immediately, and enjoy your full Scottish breakfast
